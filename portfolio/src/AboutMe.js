                <p>     Wait a sec!!  My parents named me Cindy  but i sometimes call my self Cinderelly.
                    Since my childhood i really loved dancing and mhhh fashion.<br></br>Being curious, loving to sleep and arguing were among my traits
                    which i could'nt keep them far from my life<br></br>here is the picture of me on my early journey of this awesome life of mine <span>😊</span><br></br>
                    <div className='i'><img className='lit' src={little} alt=''/></div><br></br> My kindergaten life was pretty awesome , and adventerous , as i could not keep my friends iddle as i liked so much playing with them.<br></br>
                    I grew up with the full support of my lovely parents, I went to Sunrise primary school, and that is when i met my crazy bestie Latiffa Njaa. <br></br>
                    Ohh sorry, many of you maybe unaware of someone so called Njaa but mind you shes lovely. She is so close to me <br></br>
                    in such that we share our problems. I even went several trips with her ..... it was so cooool!!<span>😍😍</span><br></br>
                    <div className='i'><img className='lit' src={njaa} alt=''/></div><br></br>So.... lets continue. During my days in primary school i had managed to form a lot of friendly relationship with bunch of students.<br></br>
                    And i had mhhhh mhhhhh a guy who we thought we loved each other....... but i think it was only childish dating.<br></br>
                    Okey so my journey continued and i went to feza girls secondary school and during my first year i dated a guy named lazaro.<br></br>
                    we were in love for almost 2 years . In form 2 I came to know a guy named Mrisho Lukamba. He was a nice guy we were friends at that time but as time passed out we began to catch feelings on one another <br></br> 
                    And my lovely life with lazzy ended up. So me and Mrisho we were jootty lovely gooty besties.<br></br>
                    in 2020 february I started dating the guy. In our life we have ups and downs but deep inside we love each other.
                    <br></br> . So right now am in A level at Alpha Secondary School . My life here is hectic as A level is tough but you know what am tougher<br></br>
                    And in Shaa Allah throughmy hardwork , focus , prayers and support from my parents and my friends.<br></br>
